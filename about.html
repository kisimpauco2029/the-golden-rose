      <h2>Who Wrote The Golden Rose?</h2>
      <p>Hello there! I am Kanchana Angela Simpauco, the author behind <em>The Golden Rose</em>, a project dedicated to exploring the history, legacy, and characters of House Tyrell. 
      Inspired by both <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> and the beauty of Highgarden, this site is a blend of lore, creativity, and admiration for the Golden Roses of Westeros.</p>

      <h2>Why House Tyrell?</h2>
      <p>Among the noble houses, the Tyrells have always stood out to me for their elegance, cunning, and charm. 
      They embody ambition paired with grace, and their words — <em>Growing Strong</em> — resonate as both a promise and a warning. 
      This site is my way of sharing that fascination with others who love the Reach and its roses.</p>

      <h2>A Note from the Author</h2>
      <p>This project is purely fan-made, created for fun and appreciation. 
      It’s a love letter to one of the most captivating families in Westeros. 
      I hope that by wandering through these pages, you too may come to admire the wit of Olenna, the ambition of Margaery, the honor of Loras, and the legacy of House Tyrell.</p>
